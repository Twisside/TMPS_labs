This code example is working with different types of travel methods and switching between them. The code uses two main SOLID principles that I’ll explain here in detail.

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**What It Means**: Each class should have only *one job* or reason to change. This helps make the code simple and easier to manage.

**How It’s Used in the Code**:
- The classes `ByWater`, `ByAir`, and `ByLand` each manage their own type of travel. They list vehicles, handle boarding/unboarding, and calculate tax for that specific type of travel. This keeps each class responsible for only its own work.
- The class `SwitchVehicle` only takes care of switching between travel types, which is also good. It doesn’t do anything else.

**Improvement**:
- Right now, the tax calculation is inside the travel classes. This mixes two responsibilities in one place (managing travel *and* calculating tax). If we moved tax calculation to another class, like `TaxCalculator`, the code would be even better at following SRP.

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**What It Means**: Classes should be open for *extension* (adding new features) but closed for *modification* (changing existing code). This makes it easier to add new things without touching working code.

**How It’s Used in the Code**:
- The code uses the `ITravel` interface. This lets us add new travel classes (like `BySpace` or `ByRail`) without changing the existing code. If I wanted to add `BySpace`, I’d just create a new class that implements `ITravel`, and the program would still work fine with `SwitchVehicle`. This is great because it allows the code to expand without breaking.

**Improvement**:
- The tax calculation is hardcoded in each travel class (`ByWater`, `ByAir`, `ByLand`). To make the code fully “closed for modification,” we could put tax logic in a separate `TaxCalculator` service, which the classes would use instead of hardcoding it. Then, if the tax rules change, we don’t need to touch the travel classes—just the tax calculator.

**Summary**

- The code is already doing **SRP** and **OCP** well, making it more organized and flexible.
- **Improvements** could include moving tax calculation out of travel classes to stick even more to **SRP** and **OCP**.
